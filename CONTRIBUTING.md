# Contributing Guidelines

If you are so kind to help and support us, please consider following these guidelines before sending PRs or commits:

- Possibly no lint errors (eslint, prettier, scss, svelte etc ...) if accidentally you find some then feel free to fix it as you go.

- Possibly no formatting errors (if you use [Atom](https://atom.io/) you just have to use the IDE default settings for formatting code and you are synced)

- Possibly use ONLY English language (everywhere in the code and outside the code)

- Possibly no English typos (it can happen of course, just try to avoid them as much as possible)

- Possibly no comments inside the code

- Possibly, just use .lint files in your IDE (don't remove or disable the linters: .eslintrc and so on)

- Possibly, just do not disable linters with inline comments (or at least remove comments as you want to PR) but be sure there are no errors in the end.

- As you finished to code your changes always make a new clean npm install (`rm -Rf node_modules/ && yarn install`)
  , Then run the app and test all your changes very deeply (`yarn dev`)
  
- Be sure to always update your node version to LTS before to start coding

These guidelines are not imperative at all, it's just the simplest method we have to be synced with you. 
You can PR any file in the repo: even this same file you are now reading. :ok_hand:

#### Look! One thing...

To be absolutely clear with you:

contributing on the ***npMax*** project, and in general on open source projects, does not mean to get paid or receive any good for the time/ and work and service you freely provide for the project. It is your time/service/work and you provide it on your own choice; Contributing to **npMax**  doesn't mean neither to get hired or to get a job in any company. By reading these contribution guidelines and before to contribute on the **npMax** project you declare you have read and accepted these conditions, thank you.

Thank you for listening :speaker:! We really would love and hope to have you on board, to have some fun and share new tricks and tips, each others of course!

Bests.
